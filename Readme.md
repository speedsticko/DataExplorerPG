This is a fork of http://code.google.com/p/stack-exchange-data-explorer/

### Why it exists? 

1. Strips out some Stack Exchange specific stuff out of DataExplorer (footer and legal)
2. Moves the repo to Git
3. Adds PostgreSQL support to Data Explorer (only querying for now)


### Why not simply integrate this into core? 

Main reason is time, it would be rather risky to add my changes as they are into the main branch, additionally allowing for custom footers and legal sections would be rather complicated. 

### What it does? 

- TODO, add some screen shots
